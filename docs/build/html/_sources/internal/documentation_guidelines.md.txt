## Documentation Guidelines
When making changes to ReEDS, you should generate and update the sources.csv and sources_documentation.md files before merging. 

```{include} ../documentation_tools/README.md
```

### Updating the ReEDS Documentation
Additionally, the general ReEDS documentation lives in the "docs/source" folder within the repo. Depending on the changes you're making to the model, please update the documentation here accordingly. 

To edit the ReEDS documentation: 
1. Find the markdown file you would like to modify under the "docs/source" folder
2. Make any necessary changes and save the file
3. Commit and push your changes as you normally would. 
   * **When your pull request gets merged into main, there is a github action that will automatically recompile the documentation with your changes and publish the updated site.**

If you would like to see what the documentation will look like when developing locally, you can do that with the following process: 
1. Navigate to the "docs/" folder 

2. Run the command `make html` to build the documentation locally
   * Ensure you have the 'reeds2' environment activated
  
3. From Finder/File Explorer, open the folder "/ReEDS-2.0/docs/build/html" then click on "index.html"
   * This will launch the documentation in a new internet window
   * If you make changes and wish to see how they are reflected in the documentation, you can run the `make html` command again and refresh the window you already have open

4. If you would like to remove the generated files, you can run the command `make clean` from the "docs/" folder

### Adding Citations in the Documentation
To add an in-text citation, find the citation key of the citation you would like to add in Zotero. The format to include an in-text citation in markdown is as follows: 
* Regular citation: ``` {cite}`citation key` ```
* Citation with just the year: ``` {cite:year}`citation key` ```
* Multiple citations: ``` {cite:p}`citation key 1, citation key 2` ```

```{figure} ../../../images/zotero_citation_example.png

Alternatively, you can use the "Zotero Citation Picker" VS Code extension for finding/adding references to the documentation. This extension requires Zotero to be installed, as well as Better BibTex for Zotero (the Better BibTex for Zotero installation guide can be found [here](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/)).
